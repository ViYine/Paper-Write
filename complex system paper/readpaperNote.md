## Abstract

Network theory has unveiled the underlying structure of complex systems such as the Internet or the biological networks in the cell. It has identified universal properties of complex networks, and the interplay between their structure and dynamics. After almost twenty years of the field, new challenges lie ahead. **These challenges concern the multilayer structure of most of the networks, the formulation of a network geometry and topology, and the development of a quantum theory of networks.** Making progress on these aspects of network theory can open new venues to address interdisciplinary and physics challenges including progress on brain dynamics, new insights into quantum technologies, and quantum gravity.

## Introduction

Initially, the physics perspective, in particular the **statistical-mechanics approach**, has dominated the field of network theory [1–7]. This point of view has played a central role to characterize the universal properties of the structure of complex networks. 

most networks obey **universal properties**: they are small world [8], they are scale free [9], and they have a non-trivial community structure [7]. 

Complex networks are responsible for significant changes in the critical behaviour of percolation, Ising model, random walks, epidemic spreading, synchronization, and controllability of networks [10–13].

The need to characterize complex systems, to extract relevant information from them, and to understand how dynamical processes are affected by the network structure, has never been more severe than in the XXI century when we are witnessing a Big Data explosion in social sciences, information and communication technologies and in biology.

## Multilayer networks

A multilayer network is not to be confused with a larger network including all the interactions. As a network ultimately is a way to encode information [72] about the underlying complex system, there is a significant difference between considering all the interactions at the same level, or including the information on the different nature of the different interactions. In a multilayer network, each interaction has a different connotation, and this property is correlated with other structural characteristics, allowing network scientists to extract significantly more information from the complex system under investigation.

In these last five years the focus of the research has been on multilayer network structure and dynamics [17]. It has been shown that considering the multilayer nature of networks can modify significantly the conclusions reached by considering single networks. A number of dynamical processes, including percolation [70,76–82], diffusion [83], epidemic spreading [84] and game theory [85] present a phenomenology that is unexpected if one consider the layers in isolation. Moreover, it has been shown that multilayer networks are characterized by significant correlations [22,86–90] in their structure that can change the dynamical properties of the multilayer network.

## Network geometry and topology
Increasing attention has been recently addressed to the geometrical and topological characterization of networks. In this field, scientific research interest has been following four major directions: characterization of the hyperbolicity of networks, formulation of emergent network geometry, characterization of brain geometry, and network topology.
